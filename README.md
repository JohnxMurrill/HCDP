# Healthcare Modeling Dynamic Program
This is a project from my time at Chapman University modeling one of the economic experiments run for research purposes. 
The project uses dynamic programming to build a cache of states in the experiment to search for the optimal investment strategy for participants, 
optimizing for earned payout at the end of the experiment.
